Machine Learning Algorithms For Diabetes.

The objective of the project is to predict whether or not a patient has diabetes, based on certain diagnostic measurements included in the dataset. The datasets consists of several medical predictor variables and one target variable, Outcome. Predictor variables includes the number of pregnancies the patient has had, their BMI, insulin level, age, and so on.During Model evaluation, I compared various machine learning algorithms on the basis of accuracy_score metric and find the best one.
